2024-09-05 09:46:59 miguistar_58253: Hey Diogo, wanna hang out soon?
2024-09-05 09:47:22 diogo_caseiro_226: Sup Miguel! Are you doing well?
2024-09-05 09:47:33 diogo_caseiro_226: I‚Äôve been a little busy lately with work in the restaurant and the SIRS project isn‚Äôt helping.
2024-09-05 09:47:53 miguistar_58253: Yeah man, all good here!
2024-09-05 09:48:05 miguistar_58253: I didn‚Äôt know you had a part time job, where are you working?
2024-09-05 09:48:18 miguistar_58253: If you‚Äôre struggling with the SIRS project I can help you out, it was the best project I ever did in my time at T√©cnico, I would be glad to help you out my brother.
2024-09-05 09:48:38 diogo_caseiro_226: I‚Äôm working at a restaurant in Oeiras, next to my house, it‚Äôs called O Pombalino.
2024-09-05 09:48:49 diogo_caseiro_226: I need to make some money on the side so I can get my Soundcloud rapper career going.
2024-09-05 09:49:11 diogo_caseiro_226: Thanks for the help btw! But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll need it, my group colleagues haven‚Äôt been doing much, just hoping they work on it.
2024-09-05 09:49:36 miguistar_58253: Good luck with the rap career man, and I hope your colleagues step on up to the plate!
2024-09-05 09:49:47 diogo_caseiro_226: Right on my brother! My new single should be out soonish!
2024-09-05 09:50:03 diogo_caseiro_226: Btw, have you heard of Jo√£o Musk? Don‚Äôt know how well he is doing lately, haven‚Äôt heard of him in a while.
2024-09-05 09:50:20 miguistar_58253: He‚Äôs doing good!
2024-09-05 09:50:34 miguistar_58253: He joined STT recently and he is becoming one of the best hackers there. He also told me that he has a crush on a girl from there, he calls her Kiti tho‚Ä¶ not sure if she‚Äôs Portuguese.
2024-09-05 09:50:46 diogo_caseiro_226: Damn‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt know bro had that dawg in him‚Ä¶
2024-09-05 09:50:59 diogo_caseiro_226: How‚Äôs the satellite project going? You guys made big moves with the launch, mad props!
2024-09-05 09:51:13 miguistar_58253: Well, about that, something‚Äôs been very sus lately‚Ä¶
2024-09-05 09:51:18 diogo_caseiro_226: Erm‚Ä¶ what the sigma? What do you mean?
2024-09-05 09:51:36 miguistar_58253: Well, one time I stayed at work a little bit late, doing some last minute stuff, and I heard Virgolino (you might know about him, he‚Äôs that kinda weird dude) and Rafael Calhau talking about some mind control stuff and restaurants in Oeiras.
2024-09-05 09:51:46 miguistar_58253: I thought it would be nothing, but then I let out a sneeze.
2024-09-05 09:51:59 miguistar_58253: I looked at them and they seemed terrified, as if I had overheard the most important thing ever, which made me very suspicious‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs probably nothing though, who would do such a thing?
2024-09-05 09:52:16 diogo_caseiro_226: Well, funny you mention that! Pombalino has been getting a lot more people than usual recently.
2024-09-05 09:52:27 diogo_caseiro_226: Our boss even hired a lot of new people. (there‚Äôs this really beautiful girl now too, oh man‚Ä¶).
2024-09-05 09:52:36 miguistar_58253: Stay on topic man!
2024-09-05 09:52:43 diogo_caseiro_226: Yea, yea! Sorry‚Ä¶
2024-09-05 09:52:55 diogo_caseiro_226: Anyways, you think people are being mind controlled to go eat at Pombalino?
2024-09-05 09:53:13 diogo_caseiro_226: What's next? Getting a girlfriend via mind control?
2024-09-05 09:53:15 diogo_caseiro_226: Get out of here.
2024-09-05 09:53:24 miguistar_58253: I just can‚Äôt shake that feeling that something‚Äôs wrong with the satellite.
2024-09-05 09:58:32 miguistar_58253: Look man, you know I never liked Virgolino.
2024-09-05 09:58:41 miguistar_58253: He was always up to something shady‚Ä¶
2024-09-05 09:58:51 miguistar_58253: Remember when I caught him in a weird empty lot in Avenida de Ceuta? And then that whole weird situation with the Millenium Tower happened?
2024-09-05 09:58:59 miguistar_58253: And now he‚Äôs involved in this‚Ä¶
2024-09-05 09:59:17 diogo_caseiro_226: Yeah, that was really weird, especially his weird meetings with the eyepatch guy‚Ä¶ he scared the shit out of me, not gonna lie.
2024-09-05 10:01:04 miguistar_58253: Anyways, I did some research online about it and I found this DECO report, take a look at it.
2024-09-05 10:01:18 miguistar_58253:
2024-09-05 10:02:01 diogo_caseiro_226: So it‚Äôs real‚Ä¶ people really have been going to restaurants in Oeiras more often, it‚Äôs not just here at Pombalino too.
2024-09-05 10:02:23 miguistar_58253: Yeah, it doesn‚Äôt seem related to anything, at least that I know of.
2024-09-05 10:02:32 miguistar_58253: Do you have any ideas of what it might be?
2024-09-05 10:02:37 diogo_caseiro_226: I don‚Äôt think anything has changed, if anything, people should be coming here less.
2024-09-05 10:02:44 diogo_caseiro_226: Remember the legionella cases?
2024-09-05 10:02:56 miguistar_58253: Good point‚Ä¶ This is all becoming very suspicious.
2024-09-05 10:03:09 miguistar_58253: Well, tonight I‚Äôm going to try to take a look at Virgolino‚Äôs computer. He usually leaves it on when he leaves at night, for some reason. See you.
2024-09-05 10:03:16 diogo_caseiro_226: Good luck man!
2024-09-05 10:03:22 diogo_caseiro_226: This whole thing is very weird.
2024-09-06 20:57:04 miguistar_58253: Hey Diogo! You won‚Äôt believe what I just found.
2024-09-06 20:57:24 diogo_caseiro_226: What‚Äôs up? You sound excited!
2024-09-06 20:57:54 miguistar_58253: I managed to access Virgolino‚Äôs computer and found some shady things. There is a bank statement with a weird transaction for a "MKU-2784"; I searched for it and seems to be linked to mind control!
2024-09-06 20:58:04 diogo_caseiro_226: That sounds intense.
2024-09-06 20:58:16 miguistar_58253: Yeah, but there's more, I also found the documentation of an API related to it and an email from Rafael telling him to execute some commands on it.
2024-09-06 20:58:28 diogo_caseiro_226: Are you serious?
2024-09-06 20:58:37 diogo_caseiro_226: That sound like a movie plot.
2024-09-06 20:58:47 miguistar_58253: I can barely believe it as well
2024-09-06 20:58:54 miguistar_58253: I‚Äôm thinking of exposing this, people need to know what‚Äôs going on.
2024-09-06 20:59:01 diogo_caseiro_226: Are you sure that‚Äôs a good idea???
2024-09-06 20:59:12 miguistar_58253: I get that it‚Äôs risky, but if it‚Äôs shady, it has to come out
2024-09-06 20:59:18 diogo_caseiro_226: I agree, but make sure that you have all the evidence you can
2024-09-06 20:59:28 diogo_caseiro_226: Dont rush it, this is not something to be taken lightly.
2024-09-06 20:59:39 miguistar_58253: I know, I‚Äôll be cautious
2024-09-06 20:59:50 miguistar_58253: I'll try to see if I can get something from Rafael as well
2024-09-06 21:00:11 diogo_caseiro_226: Keep me posted, okay? üëç
2024-09-06 21:00:27 miguistar_58253: Will do!
2024-09-08 10:59:34 miguistar_58253: Diogo, I‚Äôve dug deeper, and what I found is way more dangerous than I initially thought. We need to get this out there, but I don‚Äôt know how. I can‚Äôt just keep sitting on this information.
2024-09-08 11:00:18 diogo_caseiro_226: What did you find this time?
2024-09-08 11:00:46 miguistar_58253: I‚Äôve got proof of some MKUltra logs, Rafael Calhau's diary, and even blueprints for that satellite we talked about. This is too big for me to handle alone. I‚Äôve got proof that Rafael and Virgolino are up to something serious.
2024-09-08 11:01:00 diogo_caseiro_226: Damn, Miguel. That‚Äôs heavy.
2024-09-08 11:01:12 diogo_caseiro_226: You can‚Äôt just throw this into the public without some sort of plan.
2024-09-08 11:01:30 diogo_caseiro_226: If you do, these guys will cover their tracks, and you‚Äôll end up with nothing to show for it.
2024-09-08 11:01:53 miguistar_58253: Yeah, I know‚Ä¶ but what else can I do? I can‚Äôt trust anyone right now.
2024-09-08 11:02:09 diogo_caseiro_226: I‚Äôve been thinking about this. What if you handed the documents to Jo√£o Musk?
2024-09-08 11:02:26 diogo_caseiro_226: He‚Äôs got the right connections and knows how to deal with sensitive matters like this. He can expose it without making a scene too early.
2024-09-08 11:02:45 miguistar_58253: Jo√£o? You really think he‚Äôs the right person to handle this?
2024-09-08 11:02:55 diogo_caseiro_226: Absolutely. He‚Äôs well-connected and discreet. If anyone can get this into the right hands, it‚Äôs him. Plus, he can offer you some protection in case things get messy.
2024-09-08 11:03:15 diogo_caseiro_226: If you go to the authorities or the media now, they‚Äôll either dismiss you or Virgolino and Rafael will catch wind of it. With Jo√£o, they won‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs coming until it‚Äôs too late.
2024-09-08 11:03:51 miguistar_58253: You're right. I need to be smart about this. I‚Äôll send everything to Jo√£o. He‚Äôll know what to do.
2024-09-08 11:04:42 diogo_caseiro_226: Good. This way, the truth gets out, but in a controlled way. You‚Äôre not just blowing the whistle and hoping for the best.
2024-09-08 11:05:06 miguistar_58253: Yeah, it‚Äôs the safest option. Jo√£o can make sure the right people see it without tipping off Rafael and Virgolino.
2024-09-08 11:05:16 diogo_caseiro_226: Exactly. You‚Äôve done the hard work, Miguel. Just make sure you stay under the radar until this gets sorted out. Let Jo√£o handle the rest.
2024-09-08 11:05:28 miguistar_58253: I will. And thanks for pointing me in the right direction. I didn‚Äôt know what to do with all this until now.
2024-09-08 11:05:37 diogo_caseiro_226: Anytime, Miguel. Keep me posted on how things go with Jo√£o. We‚Äôre almost there.
