Dear Adelino,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to update you that our masterplan is working smoothly, just as we anticipated. I’ve already received the first “commission” from the restaurants we’ve engaged with. It’s a promising sign that things are moving in the right direction, and this initial success only reaffirms that we’re on the right track.

I’ll continue monitoring the situation closely and ensure that we maintain this momentum. Let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like to discuss or adjust as we move forward.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Professor Rafael Calhau
